### Description
This program utilizes several programming techniques to implement a shoe inventory system. It reads, creates, updates and views shoe data stored in a txt file named inventory-info.txt. The system employs the Shoe class to create shoe objects, and it appends these objects to a list named shoe_list. The Shoe class has several attributes such as country, code, product, cost, and quantity, and it also has several methods such as get_cost(), get_quantity(), and str(). The main menu allows the user to select various options such as creating a new shoe object, updating stock, searching for a shoe by code, calculating total value, and more. Additionally, the system is designed to prompt the user to enter a valid option if they select an invalid option.
